## Note
1. Debugging Stream Operations:
   **Trace Current Stream Chain**: This feature, accessible through the Debugger tool window, allows you to visualize the data as it passes through each operation in a stream chain. 
2. **Split Mode vs. Flat Mode**: You can choose to view the stream operations either separately (Split Mode) or all at once (Flat Mode). 
3. **Visual Representation**: The debugger provides a visual representation of how each element is transformed as it moves through the stream. 
4. **Debug tool window**: View | Tool Windows | Debug or Alt 05.
   
This feature is only available for project files. Java Stream debugger doesn't work with libraries or decompiled code.
